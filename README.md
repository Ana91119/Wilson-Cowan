# Wilson-Cowan Brain Modelling Project  
A simulation project based on the Wilson-Cowan model to explore neural population dynamics and emergent behavior in neural circuits.

## Overview  
The project focuses on modeling the collective activity of excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations using the Wilson-Cowan framework. This mean-field approach provides insights into how complex neural behaviors emerge from population-level interactions.

## Key Objectives  
- Simulate neural population dynamics using the Wilson-Cowan model.  
- Understand the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neurons.  
- Explore stable states, oscillations, and bifurcation behavior in neural networks.  

## Methodology  
1. **Introduction to Mean-Field Theory**: Understanding population-level modeling in neuroscience.  
2. **Wilson-Cowan Equations**: Simulating the dynamics of coupled excitatory and inhibitory populations.  
3. **Analysis**: Studying system stability, bifurcations, and emergent patterns of activity.  

## Key Technologies  
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib) for simulations and visualization  
- Differential equation solvers for dynamic modeling  

## Insights  
- This model helps in understanding collective neural behavior beyond individual neuron interactions.  
- Provides a simplified yet powerful framework for studying neural circuit dynamics.
